one route => another route
 		 navigation

ActivatedRoute => stored current navigation information, such as, which route data was passed, which component is currently loaded in router outlet etc. It is a built-in service class.

every time you navigate from one route to another route, an instance of ActivatedRoute is created.
In this way angular keeps history of every navigation by creating a tree of ActivatedRoute objects

Router => built-in service class from RouterModule

Pipe:
	<value-to-be-transformed>|<pipe-name>:add-arg-1:add-arg-2:......

	pipe-name(arg:any, ...add-args:any[]){
   }

1. browser do not have TS engine. so, browser can't understand the TS code.
2. Browser do not understand a module in JS/TS. So, browser will not be able to load other modules except the main JS file.

1. solution: 	convert TS code back to JS
	tool: typescript compiler (tsc)

	installation options:
	a. global (in the system - every application can use it for transpilation)
	b. local to an application: only that application can use the tool

	install:
	using a tool - Node Package Manager (npm)
	
	command:
	a. installation as part of an application (local)
	>npm i/install typescript -D

	b. global installation
	>npm i/install typescript --global

	configuration file for TSC:
	tsconfig.json (must be placed at the root of the directory)

	generate the file using command:
	>.\node_modules\.bin\tsc --init


package.json => contains dependecies list as well as other information about your application/package, such as name, version, author, scripts etc.
create package.json file
a. manually
b. using npm tool
	command: > npm init --yes (without walkthrough) or >npm init (with walkthrough)
Note: the file must be placed at the root of the application directory


	node_modules: contains all dependencies (packages)
	node_modules\.bin => executables of different dependencies
	package-lock.json => metadata about the dependencies
